# About PIQuIL

Perimeter Institute Quantum Intelligence Lab (PIQuIL) is a research centre and training hub for future leaders at the intersections of artificial intelligence and quantum systems. With partners in academia, industry, and government, PIQuIL leverages the world-class scientists and resources of Perimeter Institute to catalyze leading-edge, multidisciplinary research.

The rapid advance in artificial intelligence (AI) is attributed to decades of research in mathematics and computer science, with inspiration ranging from neuroscience to statistics and beyond. There is a strong relationship between foundational algorithms in machine learning and the fundamental physics of complex systems.

PIQuIL is a research centre where resident physicists gather to advance the use of AI algorithms in quantum physics. Residents come from a mix of academia, government, and industry, and co-exist in a unique research space designed to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. PIQuIL promotes the free exchange of scientific ideas, algorithms, and open source computer codes.

PIQuIL is also a training hub, plugged into the larger academic environment of Perimeter. Physicists, already in high demand in both academia and industry, are uniquely positioned to fill the gap for PhD-level talent in AI research. PIQuIL helps to meet this demand by providing young talent with research experience and training that will enable them to become leaders in this emerging field.

The mix of residents from academia, government, and industry creates in a constructive environment where they are permitted to manage their own intellectual property. Partners are free to use and adopt ideas, technology, and other properties conceived and developed at PIQuIL to further research or for-profit products and services. Software developed under the scientific direction of the Lab will typically be licensed as open source (e.g., Apache 2.0).

PIQuIL is located in Waterloo’s Quantum Valley, in proximity to entrepreneurs and innovators in the Communitech Hub. It aims to work in collaboration with AI centres and experts in Montreal, Ottawa, Sherbrooke, Toronto, Edmonton, and Vancouver. Scientists are located at the PIQuIL headquarters at the Communitech Data Hub in Waterloo, with access to the Perimeter Institute’s nearby facilities and resources.
